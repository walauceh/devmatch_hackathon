# Steps to operate ___ Website:

1. Firstly, make sure you are in the correct file directory. The correct file directory should end with:
```
  ..\devmatch_hackathon\my-app>
```
 In case you are in the wrong file directory, run this command:
```
  cd my-app
```
2. Run the terminal and make sure you have yarn installed. If not, run:
```
   npm install --global yarn
```
 and then run:
```
  yarn install
```
3. The next step is to run a local server to host the webpage. To do so, run:
```
  yarn dev
```
 or
```
  npm run dev
```

# Things to keep in mind:
- If you encounter CSS bugs when switching between webpages, simply reload the page and the webpage should come up as normal again
